A smile is your passport into the hearts of others.
Today it's up to you to create the peacefulness you long for.
Enjoy the good luck a companion brings you.
Land is always on the mind of a flying bird.
Our deeds determine us, as much as we determine our deeds.
The greatest risk is not taking one.
If winter comes, can spring be far behind?
For one to experience the light, they must first know what darkness is.
A stranger is a friend you have not spoken to yet.
It is now, and in this world, that we must live.
You will become great if you believe in yourself.
